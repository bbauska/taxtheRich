<h2>Stop deregulating corporate greed.</h2>
<h2>Corporations are NOT people.</h2>
<h2>Don't drink the KoolAid.</h2>

<h2>2025 DOGE is all about Tax Cuts for the filthy RICH!</h2>
Don't purge the government. The number of employees who work for the US government has stayed the same since 1975. 50 years, the population has grown 50% but the number of government employees is roughy the same. Not 50% larger! NOT!
